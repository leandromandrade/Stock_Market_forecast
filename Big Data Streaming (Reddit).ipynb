      "A black and white cat has been picked up by guards at a prison in Costa Rica and found to be carrying some hefty contraband.  The cat, which was spotted as it attempted to hop the perimeter fence at night, was discovered to have 67 grams (2.4 ounces) of crack cocaine, 230 grams (8 ounces) of cannabis, and rolling papers strapped to its back.  Officers at Pococi Penitentiary rescued the animal on Tuesday after removing the packages that had been taped to it, and confiscating the drugs.  ‚ÄúThanks to the swift actions of the responding officers, the cat was caught and the packages removed‚Äîpreventing the drugs from reaching their intended destination,\" the Costa Rican Ministry of Justice shared in a statement.  In a video shared by the Ministry, guards can be seen catching the animal as it traverses a fence topped with razor wire. Later, they are shown to be carefully cutting the drugs from the cat‚Äôs body while stroking the kitty to keep it calm.  Cats and other animals are frequently used by drug traffickers to carry illicit substances. The website Insight Crime reports that cats have been used to get drugs into prisons in Panama and Russia, with inmates attracting the animals using treats. Carrier pigeons have also been used by gangs in Argentina and Costa Rica to smuggle drugs and other contraband into prisons.  Sadly, drug gangs are increasingly using livestock to traffic their wares, often with horrific outcomes. The cattle are forced to swallow drugs before being taken across borders with the contraband hidden in their stomachs. In 2021, a ship carrying 4,000 livestock from Colombia was stopped in Spain with many of the drug-packed animals discovered to be dead or dying. A second ship, carrying 5,000 cattle, was discovered in similar circumstances in the Canary Islands at around the same time.  Thankfully, this latest story appears to have a happy ending as the BBC reports that the Costa Rican prison-breaker was handed over to the National Animal Health Service after its dalliance with dealing.\n",

Or, if there are five seat belts in the car and seven passengers, only five of them are required to wear a seatbelt.   The only probable cause for pulling them over was suspected seatbelt violations, but it turned out the officer didn't observe anything illegal.

His lawyer did everything he could to paint me in a negative light. It didn't work. My attacker received 50 years with 25 years suspended. The judge straight up told him, \"You're sorry to your wife. Your sorry to your kids. But the one person you've showed no remorse to the one person who deserves it the most.\"  In a separate county, I went through TWO domestic assault trials with my ex husband, both had substantial evidence of the abuse. Ie. A audio recordingfor the first assault and a physical witness to the second. The first conviction he received probation and mandatory anger management classes. He failed to complete his anger management classes. He went back to court for that. They dismissed the failure to comply. He kept the assault on his record.   The second assault, he was given 90 days in jail... with all the time suspended.   Justice in this country is relative to where you live. You might see the book get thrown at some people.

People don't take a trip to jail over a suspended license most of the time.  Speeding tickets while undocumented don't lead to arrests, either.

Those aren't remotely the same truck. He didn't get the wrong Ram truck. He pulled over a dark gray Ram with a full cab instead of a black Ford with a different sized cab. It was broad daylight.  If you can't tell some of the most common trucks apart *when they have different colors and sizes of cabs* you really shouldn't be doing traffic enforcement.  You even seen him pass that black F150 with the truckbed toolbox and extended cab before he pulls her over. He just plain pulls over a completely different truck.  Finally, he didn't even see the truck make a right on red. He sees the truck go by, few seconds later turns and the light is red, no truck. Then the other vehicles start moving to turn left. There is *every* possibility the Ford was turning on a green or yellow. He didn't even witness a traffic infraction, and there may not have even been one.  He fucked up at every single point, which is why his community doesn't trust him. He can't tell colors, types of truck, or size apart and didn't even see a traffic violation.

      "their life expectancy is about 4 years higher than ours. When you have a nationalized system with budget issues, you suddenly start to determine whether or not treatments are worth it. No paxlovid, which had farcical testing (claiming effectiveness vs. a cohort that neither had shots nor prior covid - who is this cohort in the real world?), and they cut back the vaccine to a limited group.   I think you should wonder what you're grasping or not about their revision to recommendations for the vaccine when they are responsible for the cost of the vaccine and the cost of treatment based on whether or not gets the vaccine. If it saves them money by preventing serious illness, they will use it. Their fall study made it clear they don't.   What do we do in the US? We count antibody titers, and ignore the two weeks after the vaccine is administered. Why would that be? Most of the US is not taking the vaccine now and mortality experience in total is nearly back to normal. What do hospital admissions look like and who are they?   We already know that if someone gets natural covid, their immunity is better. It's rough getting to that point in the initial phase, but we're not in the initial phase.  It's not difficult to see that the actual outcome data should be showing that it's more dangerous to take the booster on a regular basis now than not to. The severe AMI and thrombosis cases mentioned by the FDA for people with recent covid shows that it can be deadly to ignore that you had covid recently and take the booster, anyway. Deadly. Last comment about that was when, in 2021? It's not new information. As the FDA put it, post vaccine in nursing homes, they saw excess cases of four things. Two were thrombosis and AMI with \"surprising severity vs. baseline\". What's that for AMI? Death.   When we can measure outcomes (hospital admissions and mortality by status) instead of some near meaningless measure (count antibody titers, then assert that they are protective even if they aren't, but avoid measuring outcomes to confirm), ask yourself why the CDC, who gets mortality data by vaccine status, isn't providing it or showing that severe disease or death is improved over a full year by different statuses.   Add denmark and a whole host of other public health systems where the booster is not provided to people who are not elderly or at risk, then go back and read pfizer's booster defense and the FDA criticism of it (the lower ranking criticism was overridden).   We are just about the only place left where average people who aren't elderly or compromised think there is some benefit to taking the vaccine because of marketing and misinformation from letter agencies to go along with it. the even more farcical part of this is it's supposedly the \"educated position\".\n"

      "Did you answer the right person? What they're saying is that the system itself is flawed because the ones who are still, largely, in power are those who have been prejudiced against minorities for generations. It hasn't even been a full three generations since social changes regarding minorities started to change. Five decades ago rape was even more taboo than it is now. The system hasn't been around for long and it needs to be improved in many many ways, because those who need it to work the most usually get left behind.  They're not blaming the victims of the system. They're saying the system has failed them.  \"It works if we want it to (but people are assholes)\" doesn't mean \"it works if minorities work harder\", it means that the system has the potential to work but those within it need to do better. Judges, lawyers, every part of the justice system‚Äîbut there's a lot of assholes there who haven't gotten over old prejudice and bias, and so it doesn't work as it should.\n",

      "On movie sets, actors play a crucial, but indirect, role in gun safety. While the primary responsibility for ensuring firearms are handled safely lies with the production's armorer or weapons specialist, actors are expected to: Treat all firearms as if they are loaded: This is a fundamental rule, regardless of whether the weapon is a real firearm or a replica.  Follow the armorer's instructions: Actors should always adhere to the specific instructions provided by the armorer on how to handle and use the firearm.  Never interfere with firearms unless instructed to do so: Actors should not open the chamber, remove magazines, or perform any other actions on a firearm unless directed by the armorer.  Be honest about their knowledge of firearms: If an actor has limited or no experience with firearms, they should inform the armorer so that they can be properly trained and instructed on the safe handling of the weapon.  Maintain awareness of their surroundings: Actors should be mindful of the presence of other crew members and actors, especially when a firearm is being handled or fired.\n"
